Java Features
>>> Java 8 <<<
- forEach() method in Iterable interface
- default and static methods in Interfaces
- Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
- Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
N1: collectors

- Java Time API
It has always been hard to work with Date, Time and Time Zones in java. There was no standard approach or API in java for date and time in Java. One of the nice addition in Java 8 is the java.time package that will streamline the process of working with time in java.
Just by looking at Java Time API packages, I can sense that it will be very easy to use. It has some sub-packages java.time.format that provides classes to print and parse dates and times and java.time.zone provides support for time-zones and their rules.
The new Time API prefers enums over integer constants for months and days of the week. One of the useful class is DateTimeFormatter for converting DateTime objects to strings.

- Collection API improvements
Some new methods added in Collection API are:
Iterator default method forEachRemaining(Consumer action) to perform the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or the action throws an exception.
Collection default method removeIf(Predicate filter) to remove all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.
Collection spliterator() method returning Spliterator instance that can be used to traverse elements sequentially or parallel.
Map replaceAll(), compute(), merge() methods.
Performance Improvement for HashMap class with Key Collisions

- Concurrency API improvements
Some important concurrent API enhancements are:
ConcurrentHashMap compute(), forEach(), forEachEntry(), forEachKey(), forEachValue(), merge(), reduce() and search() methods.
CompletableFuture that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status).
Executors newWorkStealingPool() method to create a work-stealing thread pool using all available processors as its target parallelism level.

- Java IO improvements
Files.list(Path dir) that returns a lazily populated Stream, the elements of which are the entries in the directory.
Files.lines(Path path) that reads all lines from a file as a Stream.
Files.find() that returns a Stream that is lazily populated with Path by searching for files in a file tree rooted at a given starting file.
BufferedReader.lines() that return a Stream, the elements of which are lines read from this BufferedReader.

- Miscellaneous Core API improvements
ThreadLocal static method withInitial(Supplier supplier) to create instance easily.
Comparator interface has been extended with a lot of default and static methods for natural ordering, reverse order etc.
min(), max() and sum() methods in Integer, Long and Double wrapper classes.
logicalAnd(), logicalOr() and logicalXor() methods in Boolean class.
ZipFile.stream() method to get an ordered Stream over the ZIP file entries. Entries appear in the Stream in the order they appear in the central directory of the ZIP file.
Several utility methods in Math class.
jjs command is added to invoke Nashorn Engine.
jdeps command is added to analyze class files
JDBC-ODBC Bridge has been removed.
PermGen memory space has been removed

>>> Java 9 <<<
Some of the important java 9 features are;
- Java 9 REPL (JShell)

- Factory Methods for Immutable List, Set, Map and Map.Entry
Empty List Example
List immutableList = List.of();
Non-Empty List Example
List immutableList = List.of("one","two","three");

Empty Map Example
Map emptyImmutableMap = Map.of()
Non-Empty Map Example
Map nonemptyImmutableMap = Map.of(1, "one", 2, "two", 3, "three")

- Private methods in Interfaces

- Java 9 Module System

- Process API Improvements

- Try With Resources Improvement

- CompletableFuture API Improvements
In Java SE 9, Oracle Corp is going to improve CompletableFuture API to solve some problems raised in Java SE 8. They are going add to support some delays and timeouts, some utility methods and better sub-classing.
Executor exe = CompletableFuture.delayedExecutor(50L, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
Here delayedExecutor() is a static utility method used to return a new Executor that submits a task to the default executor after the given delay.

- Reactive Streams
https://www.journaldev.com/20723/java-9-reactive-streams
kind of "RxJava"

- Diamond Operator for Anonymous Inner Class

- Optional Class Improvements
n Java SE 9, Oracle Corp is going to release New HTTP 2 Client API to support HTTP/2 protocol and WebSocket features. As existing or Legacy HTTP Client API has numerous issues (like supports HTTP/1.1 protocol and does not support HTTP/2 protocol and WebSocket, works only in Blocking mode and lot of performance issues.), they are replacing this HttpURLConnection API with new HTTP client.

They are going to introduce a new HTTP 2 Client API under the “java.net.http” package. It supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. It supports both Synchronous (Blocking Mode) and Asynchronous Modes. It supports Asynchronous Mode using the WebSocket API.

We can see this new API at https://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/net/http/package-summary.html

HTTP 2 Client Example

jshell> import java.net.http.*
jshell> import static java.net.http.HttpRequest.*
jshell> import static java.net.http.HttpResponse.*
jshell> URI uri = new URI("https://rams4java.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/java-news.html")
uri ==> https://rams4java.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/java-news.html
jshell> HttpResponse response = HttpRequest.create(uri).body(noBody()).GET().response()
response ==> java.net.http.HttpResponseImpl@79efed2d
jshell> System.out.println("Response was " + response.body(asString()))

- Stream API Improvements
- Enhanced @Deprecated annotation
- HTTP 2 Client
- Multi-Resolution Image API
- Miscellaneous Java 9 Features

>>> Java 10 <<<

1.1 Time-Based Release Versioning (JEP 322)

1.2 Local-Variable Type Inference (JEP 286)
var numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // inferred value ArrayList<String>
// Index of Enhanced For Loop
for (var number : numbers) {
	System.out.println(number);
}
// Local variable declared in a loop
for (var i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
	System.out.println(numbers.get(i));
}

1.3 Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler (JEP 317)
1.4 Application Class-Data Sharing (JEP 310)
1.5 Parallel Full GC for G1 (JEP 307)
1.6 Garbage-Collector Interface (JEP 304)
1.7 Additional Unicode Language-Tag Extensions (JEP 314)
1.8 Root Certificates (JEP 319)
1.9 Thread-Local Handshakes (JEP 312)
1.10 Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices (JEP 316)
1.11 Remove the Native-Header Generation Tool – javah (JEP 313)
1.12 Consolidate the JDK Forest into a Single Repository (JEP 296)

1.13 API Changes
Let’s go through a few additions:
List, Map & Set Interfaces are added with a static copyOf(Collection) method. Its returns an unmodifiable List, Map or Set containing the entries provided. For a List, if the given List is subsequently modified, the returned List will not reflect such modifications.
Optional & its primitive variations get a method orElseThrow(). This is exactly same as get(), however the java doc states that it is a preferred alternative then get()
Collectors class gets various methods for collecting unmodifiable collections (Set, List, Map)

>>> Java 11 <<<
(NOTE: First commercial paid JDK)

4.1 4.1) Running Java File with single command
One major change is that you don’t need to compile the java source file with javac tool first. You can directly run the file with java command and it implicitly compiles.
This feature comes under JEP 330.

4.2 4.2) Java String Methods
isBlank() – This instance method returns a boolean value. Empty Strings and Strings with only white spaces are treated as blank.
lines() - This method returns a stream of strings, which is a collection of all substrings split by lines.
strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing()
strip() – Removes the white space from both, beginning and the end of string.

4.3 4.3) Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters
JEP 323, Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters is the only language feature release in Java 11.
In Java 10, Local Variable Type Inference was introduced. Thus we could infer the type of the variable from the RHS – var list = new ArrayList<String>();
JEP 323 allows var to be used to declare the formal parameters of an implicitly typed lambda expression.
We can now define :
(var s1, var s2) -> s1 + s2
This was possible in Java 8 too but got removed in Java 10. Now it’s back in Java 11 to keep things uniform.

Limitation of this feature – You must specify the type var on all parameters or none.

4.4 4.4) Nested Based Access Control
4.5 4.5) JEP 309: Dynamic Class-File Constants
4.6 4.6) JEP 318: Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector
4.7 4.7) JEP 320: Remove the Java EE and CORBA Modules
4.8 4.8) JEP 328: Flight Recorder

4.9 4.9) JEP 321: HTTP Client
Java 11 standardizes the Http CLient API.
The new API supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. It is designed to improve the overall performance of sending requests by a client and receiving responses from the server. It also natively supports WebSockets.

4.10 4.10) Reading/Writing Strings to and from the Files
Java 11 strives to make reading and writing of String convenient.
It has introduced the following methods for reading and writing to/from the files:
readString()
writeString()
Following code showcases an example of this:

Path path = Files.writeString(Files.createTempFile("test", ".txt"), "This was posted on JD");
System.out.println(path);
String s = Files.readString(path);
System.out.println(s); //This was posted on JD

4.11 4.11) JEP 329: ChaCha20 and Poly1305 Cryptographic Algorithms
4.12 4.12) JEP 315: Improve Aarch64 Intrinsics
4.13 4.13) JEP 333: ZGC: A Scalable Low-Latency Garbage Collector (Experimental)
4.14 4.14) JEP 335: Deprecate the Nashorn JavaScript Engine

>>> Java 12 <<<
2 JVM Changes
2.1 1. JEP 189 – Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Experimental)
2.2 2. JEP 346 – Promptly Return Unused Committed Memory from G1
2.3 3. JEP 344 : Abortable Mixed Collections for G1
2.4 4. JEP 230 and 344
2.5 5. JEP 341 Default CDS Archives

3 Language Changes And Features
3.1 1. Switch Expressions (Preview)
Java 12 has enhanced Switch expressions for Pattern matching.
Introduced in JEP 325, as a preview language feature, the new Syntax is L ->.

Following are some things to note about Switch Expressions:

The new Syntax removes the need for break statement to prevent fallthroughs.
Switch Expressions don’t fall through anymore.
Furthermore, we can define multiple constants in the same label.
default case is now compulsory in Switch Expressions.
break is used in Switch Expressions to return values from a case itself.

String result = switch (day) {
            case "M", "W", "F" -> "MWF";
            case "T", "TH", "S" -> "TTS";
            default -> {
                if(day.isEmpty())
                    break "Please insert a valid day.";
                else
                    break "Looks like a Sunday.";
            }

        };

        System.out.println(result);

3.2 2. File.mismatch method
Java 12 added the following method to compare two files:
public static long mismatch(Path path, Path path2) throws IOException
This method returns the position of the first mismatch or -1L if there is no mismatch.

Two files can have a mismatch in the following scenarios:
If the bytes are not identical. In this case, the position of the first mismatching byte is returned.
File sizes are not identical. In this case, the size of the smaller file is returned.

3.3 3. Compact Number Formatting
mport java.text.NumberFormat;
import java.util.Locale;
public class CompactNumberFormatting {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Compact Formatting is:");
        NumberFormat upvotes = NumberFormat
                .getCompactNumberInstance(new Locale("en", "US"), NumberFormat.Style.SHORT);
        upvotes.setMaximumFractionDigits(1);

        System.out.println(upvotes.format(2592) + " upvotes");

        NumberFormat upvotes2 = NumberFormat
                .getCompactNumberInstance(new Locale("en", "US"), NumberFormat.Style.LONG);
        upvotes2.setMaximumFractionDigits(2);
        System.out.println(upvotes2.format(2011) + " upvotes");
    }
}

3.4 4. Teeing Collectors
Teeing Collector is the new collector utility introduced in the Streams API.
This collector has three arguments – Two collectors and a Bi-function.
All input values are passed to each collector and the result is available in the Bi-function.
double mean = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                .collect(Collectors.teeing(
                        summingDouble(i -> i),
                        counting(),
                        (sum, n) -> sum / n));

System.out.println(mean);

3.5 5. Java Strings New Methods
4 new methods have been introduced in Java 12 which are:
indent(int n)
transform(Function f)
Optional describeConstable()
String resolveConstantDesc​(MethodHandles.Lookup lookup)

3.6 6. JEP 334: JVM Constants API

3.7 7. JEP 305: Pattern Matching for instanceof (Preview)
Another Preview Language feature!

The old way to typecast a type to another type is:


if (obj instanceof String) {
    String s = (String) obj;
    // use s in your code from here
}
The new way is :


if (obj instanceof String s) {
    // can use s directly here
} 

>>> Java 13 <<<
- Text Blocks – JEP 355
This is a preview feature. It allows us to create multiline strings easily. The multiline string has to be written inside a pair of triple-double quotes.
The string object created using text blocks has no additional properties. It’s an easier way to create multiline strings. We can’t use text blocks to create a single-line string.
The opening triple-double quotes must be followed by a line terminator.

String textBlock = """
				Hi
				Hello
				Yes""";
				
- New Methods in String Class for Text Blocks
There are three new methods in the String class, associated with the text blocks feature.
formatted(Object… args): it’s similar to the String format() method. It’s added to support formatting with the text blocks.
stripIndent(): used to remove the incidental white space characters from the beginning and end of every line in the text block. This method is used by the text blocks and it preserves the relative indentation of the content.
translateEscapes(): returns a string whose value is this string, with escape sequences translated as if in a string literal.

- Switch Expressions Enhancements – JEP 354
Switch expressions were added as a preview feature in Java 12 release. It’s almost same in Java 13 except that the “break” has been replaced with “yield” to return a value from the case statement.

- Reimplement the Legacy Socket API – JEP 353
- Dynamic CDS Archive – JEP 350
- ZGC: Uncommit Unused Memory – JEP 351
